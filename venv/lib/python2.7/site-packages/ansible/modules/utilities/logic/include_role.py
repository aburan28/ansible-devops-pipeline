author: Ansible Core Team (@ansible)
module: include_role
short_description: Load and execute a role
description:
  - Loads and executes a role as a task dynamically. This frees roles from the `roles:` directive and allows them to be
    treated more as tasks.
  - Unlike M(import_role), most keywords, including loops and conditionals, apply to this statement.
  - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
version_added: "2.2"
options:
  apply:
    description:
      - Accepts a hash of task keywords (e.g. C(tags), C(become)) that will be applied to the tasks within the include.
    version_added: '2.7'
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the role to be executed.
    required: True
  tasks_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(tasks/) directory.
    default: main
  vars_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(vars/) directory.
    default: main
  defaults_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(defaults/) directory.
    default: main
  allow_duplicates:
    description:
      - Overrides the role's metadata setting to allow using a role more than once with the same parameters.
    type: bool
    default: 'yes'
  private:
    description:
      - This option is a no op, and the functionality described in previous versions was not implemented. This
        option will be removed in Ansible v2.8.
  public:
    description:
      - This option dictates whether the role's C(vars) and C(defaults) are exposed to the playbook. If set to C(yes)
        the variables will be available to tasks following the C(include_role) task. This functionality differs from
        standard variable exposure for roles listed under the C(roles) header or C(import_role) as they are exposed at
        playbook parsing time, and available to earlier roles and tasks as well.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
    version_added: '2.7'
notes:
  - Handlers are made available to the whole play.
  - Before Ansible 2.4, as with C(include), this task could be static or dynamic, If static, it implied that it won't
    need templating, loops or conditionals and will show included tasks in the `--list` options. Ansible would try to
    autodetect what is needed, but you can set `static` to `yes` or `no` at task level to control this.
  - After Ansible 2.4, you can use M(import_role) for 'static' behaviour and this action for 'dynamic' one.
