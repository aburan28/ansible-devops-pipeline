author: Ansible Core Team (@ansible)
module: import_role
short_description: Import a role into a play
description:
  - Much like the `roles:` keyword, this task loads a role, but it allows you to control it when the role tasks run in
    between other tasks of the play.
  - Most keywords, loops and conditionals will only be applied to the imported tasks, not to this statement itself. If
    you want the opposite behavior, use M(include_role) instead. To better understand the difference you can read
    the L(Including and Importing Guide,../user_guide/playbooks_reuse_includes.html).
version_added: "2.4"
options:
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the role to be executed.
    required: True
  tasks_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(tasks/) directory.
    default: main
  vars_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(vars/) directory.
    default: main
  defaults_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(defaults/) directory.
    default: main
  allow_duplicates:
    description:
      - Overrides the role's metadata setting to allow using a role more than once with the same parameters.
    type: bool
    default: 'yes'
  private:
    description:
      - This option is a no op, and the functionality described in previous versions was not implemented. This
        option will be removed in Ansible v2.8.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
notes:
  - Handlers are made available to the whole play.
  - "Since Ansible 2.7: variables defined in C(vars) and C(defaults) for the role are exposed at playbook parsing time.
    Due to this, these variables will be accessible to roles and tasks executed before the location of the
    C(import_role) task."
  - Unlike C(include_role) variable exposure is not configurable, and will always be exposed.
